## Cocktail
 
 Cocktail is a fast front-end builder. It takes the basic code by [Codeigniter-Boilerplate](http://ariok.github.io/codeigniter-boilerplate/) but upgrades Codeigniter to version 3, HTML5Boileplate to the v. 5 and jQuery to v.1.11.2\. Then it adds Bootstrap (v.3) and bundles several scripts to improve your job.

*   Extend Bootstrap icons with [Font Awesome 4.0.5](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
*   Show fancy tables with [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
*   Have nice galleries with [Bootstrap Lightbox](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/)
*   Be _Cookie law_ ready with [Jquery CookieBar](http://www.primebox.co.uk/projects/jquery-cookiebar/)

Moreover there are some 'ad hoc' templates, helpers and functions for page rendering:

*   Automatic Toc
*   Portfolio
*   .pretty-pre selector
