## Cocktail

<b>Version 0.0.6 alpha</b>
 
Cocktail is a fast front-end builder. It takes the basic code by [Codeigniter-Boilerplate](http://ariok.github.io/codeigniter-boilerplate/) but upgrades Codeigniter to version 3, HTML5Boileplate to v. 5. Then it adds Bootstrap (v.3) and bundles several scripts to improve your job.#

Cocktail is NOT a end user product, at this stage is more or less a bucket of prototypes and scripts built on top of three solid frameworks.

The most relevant bundled scripts are:

* A minification library to improve your performances in production environment
*   [Font Awesome 4.0.5](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
*   [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
*   [Bootstrap Lightbox](http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/)
*   [Jquery CookieBar](http://www.primebox.co.uk/projects/jquery-cookiebar/)
* <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie 1.4</a> to read and create rss/atom feeds

Moreover there are some 'ad hoc' templates, helpers and functions for page rendering:

*   Automatic Toc
* Automatic Tabs
* Nifty Footnotes
* Templates for horizontal and vertical layout
* Five footer templates
*   A Portfolio template
*   An Open Data Client with a json endpoint
*   Some nice helpers
